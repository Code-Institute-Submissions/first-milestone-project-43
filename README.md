## Testing

The code has been validated by using;

- [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/)
- [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

### Result

**Document checking completed. No errors or warnings to show.**

I have used bootstrap framework to make website responsive.
1. The website has been tested on different web browsers like Microsoft Edge, Google Chroome and Opera found responsive. 
2. The website was also tested on different mobiles phones screen sizes and found responsive.
On screen size L-1440px and L-1024px page shows three columns and on tablet-768px the right column will come underneath the
middle column. On small screen sizes 425px or less the navigation buttons will come underneath the job title and middle colomn
will come underneath the picture and social links will come underneath copyright content giving a nice effect to the visitors.
However on big screen sizes like 4k-2560px content looked very small leaving big empty spaces on the page.
##### Media Query for 4k-2560 px Big Screen
To overcome this problem, I wrote separate media query. I tested then on my home 4K-Ultra HD TV and looks nice.
Required attribute is added in all fields of the form like name, email and idea description. If any field left empty it will 
be notified. Further if wrong email is entered, it will also be notified.
##### Heading Tags & Classes
The name and main job title has given tags h2 and h4 respectively. Where as all main headings inside section area have 
given tag h4 and a common ofclass heading-title. Only form heading has a different class which is contact-heading. All my work history 
titles have tag h6 and a common class job-title. This has made it easier to style them.
